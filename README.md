# Face Recognition With Python

About: This respository contains the upgrade from the event "Hackathon Show Rural 2023" wich was developed previously by "The ByteBuster" team. Now I'm the only one responsible for the code.

Challenge: Hygiene control and contamination prevention in poultry farms.

One of the biggest problems with chicken contamination is salmonella. This bacteria can be transmitted by several sources, one of which is people bringing the bacteria through their clothes, accessories, hair or skin. To minimize this situation, everyone who enters the farms must shower and wear a uniform, this is a common practice and even required by law.

The challenge is: How to ensure that the bath was taken respecting each person's privacy?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution Developed: Taking into account the privacy of employees, it was proposed to use facial recognition when entering and exiting the bathrooms. This way, we can control who entered the bathrooms, and also have time control, once someone is “captured”, the entry and exit time is stored, so we can calculate the approximate time each person takes in the shower. The system is also capable of create visitors which must pass through the same process.

The code is now changing to it's Oriented Object Version.
